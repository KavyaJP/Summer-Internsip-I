# Summer Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects developed during my summer internship, demonstrating skills in full-stack web development, API integration, and data visualization using Python.

---

## Projects Overview

This repository is organized into two main projects:

1.  **Interactive Recipe Finder**: A Flask web application that allows users to find recipes based on a single ingredient they have on hand.
2.  **Weather Dashboard**: A dynamic dashboard that provides real-time weather conditions and a multi-day forecast for any city.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used across both projects:

* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Data Handling**: `requests` for API calls, `pandas`
* **Visualization**: `matplotlib`
* **Templating**: Jinja2
